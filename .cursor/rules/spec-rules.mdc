# Cypress test rules

- follow the patterns in the existing Cypress spec files
- always use the global test selectors file [selectors.ts](mdc:cypress/support/selectors.ts)
- if the frontend element lacks `data-cy` attribute, add it and add a constant in the [selectors.ts](mdc:cypress/support/selectors.ts) file
