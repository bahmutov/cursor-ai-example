# Pull request rule

VERY IMPORTANT: always make a new branch for each feature.

## Git rules

- remember the current branch name before creating the new branch
- always use GitHub CLI "gh" to create branches and pull requests using `gh pr create <pr name>`
- always follow semantic commit convention when naming commits
- finish the feature by adding a commit
- open a GitHub pull request between the current branch and its base / parent branch
